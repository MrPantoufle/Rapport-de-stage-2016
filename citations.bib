abstract = "Computations of transitive closure and reduction of directed acyclic graphs are mainly considered in this paper. Classes of directed acyclic graphs for which such problems can be solved in linear time complexity (in accordance with the number of arcs) are proposed, namely: generalized N-free graphs, graphs such that the external or internal degree of any vertex is bounded in the transitive reduction, and bounded decomposition width orders, strongly W-free orders. For this purpose, we study the worst-case complexity of a nice algorithm. This algorithm is due to Goralcikova and Koubek (1979) and already studied by Mehlhorn (1984) and Simon (1988). Furthermore, two new classes of orders (generalized N-free and strongly W-free) which seem to have nice computational properties, are proposed and studied."

abstract = "Graph sandwich problems were introduced by Golumbic et al. (1994) in [12] for \{DNA\} physical mapping problems and can be described as follows. Given a property Π of graphs and two disjoint sets of edges E 1 , E 2 with E 1 ⊆ E 2 on a vertex set V , the problem is to find a graph G on V with edge set E s having property Π and such that E 1 ⊆ E s ⊆ E 2 . In this paper, we exhibit a quasi-linear reduction between the problem of finding an independent set of size k ≥ 2 in a graph and the problem of finding a sandwich homogeneous set of the same size k . Using this reduction, we prove that a number of natural (decision and counting) problems related to sandwich homogeneous sets are hard in general. We then exploit a little further the reduction and show that finding efficient algorithms to compute small sandwich homogeneous sets would imply substantial improvement for computing triangles in graphs.
